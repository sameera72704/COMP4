## Description
This project is a simple game built using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). This game has a character named "Goopy," who can move horizontally across the screen and shoot a boxing glove. The game also includes a background image and a square.

### Features
//Describe what your major decisions were and why you did things that way.
1. The game displays a background image, a simple square, and the player. 
2. This has player movement such that the player can move left and right using the arrow keys; also, the player movement is restricted within the window borders to stop the player from moving off-screen. 
3. The player can shoot a boxing glove upwards by pressing the space bar with a delay of 0.5 seconds.


### Issues
No issues were faced during the execution of the program.

### Extra Feature
//Describe anything special you did.  This is required to earn points.
The extra feature in the project is a shooting delay mechanism for the glove. This is implemented using SFML.

## Integrity
//Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:

Engages in conduct aimed at making false representation of a student's academic performance:

Any activity that is employed to portray a student's performance is a threat to the validity of the education system. Such behavior encompasses cheating, plagiarism, or fabrication of data and assignments. It deceives instructors and educational institutions, while downplaying the efforts of other students who try to fulfill their academic obligations. Such actions have long-term repercussions because it distorts the student's capabilities and might be an unfair advantage over others in future academic or professional pursuits. Apart from that, such behavior deprives one of acquiring the important skills and knowledge which education would have provided to an individual for his personal good and the benefit of society. Academic deceit reduces trust within the academic community and may subsequently set off disciplinary actions including expulsion and revocation of degree. Ethical standards at school aim to ensure that fairness, accountability, and growth are achieved, and students are expected to uphold such values through honest and diligent work. Making false representations of academic performance undermines such values and erodes the credibility of the entire educational institution.
